# Python Password Generator

This is a simple Python program that generates random passwords based on user input. The user can specify the length of the password and the program provides a randomly generated password that contains a combination of letters, digits, and special characters.

##Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your computer. The program is compatible with Python 3.x.

## Installation

To use this program, you can download the repository to your local machine or clone it to your GitHub account using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/iluech/python-password-generator.git

## Usage

To run the program, navigate to the directory where the program is located in the command prompt and run the following command:

run.bat

This will start the program and prompt you to enter your preferred password length. After entering the length, the program will generate a random password that contains a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

The program will then prompt you to create another password. If you choose "Y" or "y", the program will ask for a new password length and generate a new password. If you choose "N" or "n", the program will exit.
